## Assignment 1 - Portfolio

## Description
This site was made for the first homework assignment at Trilogy Education Services' coding bootcamp. It was made to follow a visual guideline where I had to start from scratch to recreate given screencaps for a three page website. Through this, I have been able to demonstrate a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.

The biggest takeaway from this project is that the solution is often much simpler than I make it out to be. Will carry this line of thinking into future projects.
